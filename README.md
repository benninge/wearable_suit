# Smart dancing suit

The smart dancing suit project is part of the [Wearable Computing Systems Lab Course](https://es.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/teaching/wearable-lab) in SS2017. The idea is to develop an LED covered dancing suit which generates a light show according to the current music and movements of the wearer, instead of running a predefined choreography like it is done in other approaches.
